# A-Hands-on-introduction-to-Reinforcement-Learning-RL-with-Python
We will get introduced to reinforcement learning and also implement a simple example of the same in Python. It will be a basic code to demonstrate the working of an RL algorithm. Brief exposure to object-oriented programming in Python, machine learning, or deep learning will also be a plus point.
